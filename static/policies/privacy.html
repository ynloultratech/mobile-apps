                This Policy explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by us with respect to your access and use of our mobile application (“App”), and websites, and online products and services provided therein (collectively with the App and Sites, the “Service”), so that you can make an informed decision about using the Service.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, the collection, use and disclosure of information by merchants that issue and redeem gift cards using the Service are governed by the privacy policies of those merchants.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the homepage of our App and/or Sites or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used. </p>
            <p>
                These Terms are a legal agreement between you (“you,” or “your”) and us. By purchasing our products and/or clicking to “Accept” these Terms where that option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not make any purchases from us.

                What Is Personally Identifiable Information?
            </p>
            <p>
                As used in this Policy, the term “personally identifiable information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or email address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the aggregate use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, or data that has been reasonably de-identified and from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has reasonably been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate or de-identified information.
            </p>
            <p>
                What Information Do We Collect?
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h2 id="active_collection">Active Collection</h2>
            </div>

            <p>
                We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service. For example, we collect information that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email or create an account). Such information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, social network data, other account data, and financial information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.
            </p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h2 id="automatically_collected">Automatically Collected When You Use our Service</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                When you use the Service, some information is also automatically collected. For example, we may automatically collect certain information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address (which we may use to estimate your approximate location), unique device identifiers, your mobile number, your device model and name, your operating system, your browser type, your preferred language, and your activity on the Service. We may also automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about how you use various features of our Service and information about the number, frequency and length of each session. We treat this information as personally identifiable information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, this information is used in aggregate or de-identified form only.
            </p>
            <p>
                In connection with our App, we may collect information about the precise geolocation of your device with your consent. For information about how to disable this collection, please see “Your Choices” below. Please note that our collection of geolocation is in addition to our use of your IP address to estimate your approximate location.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies” when you use the Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information. If you wish to block, erase or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or Service Providers (as defined below) is not covered by this Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service. We may link the information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally identifiable information will be stored on secured servers, and we may store and process personally identifiable information in the United States and other countries.
            </p>
            <div class="page-header">
                <h2 id="from_other_sources">Information We Collect From Other Sources:</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Service. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, profile photo and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
            </p>
            <p>
                How Do We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect?
            </p>
            <p>
                We use personally identifiable information collected through the Service for the purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Service. For example, we may use personally identifiable information we collect:

                What Personally Identifiable Information Do We Share With Third-Parties?
            </p>
            <p>
                We will not knowingly share the personally identifiable information we collect from you through the Service with third-parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Service. For example, we may share personally identifiable information as follows:

                <li>
                    with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (such as a credit card processing company to bill you for the Service and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf) (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Service and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us;
                </li>
                <li>
                    with fraud prevention companies that may use information about you to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent or other illegal transactions;
                </li>
                <li>
                    when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you on the Service that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;
                </li>
                <li>
                    in an aggregated or de-identified form that does not reasonably identify you;
                </li>
                <li>
                    when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or to respond to lawful requests or legal authorities including, but not limited to, responding to lawful subpoenas, warrants or court orders;
                </li>
                <li>
