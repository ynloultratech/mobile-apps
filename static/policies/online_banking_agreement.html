                <h3 id="enrollment">Enrollment Process</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                You must complete the enrollment process to use the Service. You can enroll for the Service on the Internet.
</p><p>
The Internet enrollment process involves completing a secure online application that we will use to verify your identity.

         <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="signature">Signature Requirements</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                When any transfer, ACH, or other Payment Instruction is initiated through the Service for your benefit, you agree that we may debit the designated Eligible Accounts without requiring your signature on the item and without any notice to you.

</p><p>
The balances within the Service are updated periodically and the Service will display the most current "as of" date on the "accounts" summary page.

            </p>
        <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                We understand how important privacy is to our customers. We have taken steps to protect the privacy and security of your personal information as well as your financial transactions with us. You should read our privacy notice before completing the enrollment process for the Service.

            <p>
               It is our general policy to treat your account information as confidential. However, we will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transactions you make ONLY in the following situations:
</p><ul>

</li><li>Where it is necessary for activating additional services;
</li><li>In order to verify the existence and condition of your account to a credit bureau or Biller;

</li><li>If you give us your written permission.
</li></ul>
Please refer to our privacy notice for additional detail on disclosure of account information.

                <h3 id="security">Card Security</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
            <b>Bridge Community Bank considers the security of your debit card to be of utmost importance. Consequently, we will keep your card in an “OFF” status until you want to use it. We provide a quick and easy way for you to change your card to an “ON” status whenever you want to use your card. Once you switch your card ON, we will automatically change the status back to OFF once you have completed a transaction, or after a specified period of time, depending upon the option you choose in your Account Profile.  You agree, however, charges for recurring billing that you have authorized from a third party, will be posted to your Account even though your card is in an OFF state. You agree that it is your responsibility to notify your third parties if any such billings are to be terminated. Please note you will need internet access to change the status of your card. If you do NOT HAVE ready access to the internet, you may not want to open an Account on the system. By proceeding to open an Account, you agree to these operating rules.</b>
            </p>
    <div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="internetsecurity">Internet Security</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
The Service utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect your accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. Prior to activating your access to the Service, our Internet Banking Service will verify the information you provide to us regarding your identity. In cases where we cannot satisfactorily verify your information, we may not accept your application to use the Service.
</p><p>
<b>Usernames and Passwords</b> - One of the main security features protecting the Service is the unique combination of your Username and Password. During the enrollment process, you will be assigned a unique Username, and then you may choose a Password that will be used to gain access to the Service. You determine your own Password, which is encrypted in our database. Neither this Institution nor its Service Providers have access to this information. The Service will automatically deactivate your account after three unsuccessful login attempts within a 24-hour time frame. You may reset your password by contacting Bridge Community Bank.
    </p><p>
Because your Password is used to access your accounts, you should treat it as you would any other sensitive personal data.
</p><ul>
<li>You should carefully select a Password that is hard to guess.
</li><li>You should not use words based on your name, address or other personal information.
</li><li>Keep your Password safe.
</li><li>Memorize your Password and do NOT write it down.
</li><li>You will be prompted to change your password every 180 days.
</li><li>A Password should be changed immediately if you suspect that your Password has been compromised. This can be done at any time from the “Profile” menu after you log on to the Service.
</li></ul>

NEITHER THIS INSTITUTION NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL EVER CONTACT YOU VIA TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTING PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR USERNAME, OR YOUR PASSWORD. IF YOU ARE CONTACTED BY ANYONE REQUESTING THIS INFORMATION, REFUSE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND PLEASE CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY.
<p></p><p>
<b>Encryption</b> – The Service uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology for everything you do while using Internet banking. Your browser automatically activates this technology when it attempts to connect to our Service. The Service requires a browser that supports 128-bit encryption. The Service will warn you if your browser does not meet this requirement.
</p><p>
Whenever SSL is securing your communications, the browser will typically indicate this secure session by changing the appearance of a small icon of a padlock at the bottom of the screen from “open” to “locked”. What this means to you is that your communications are scrambled from your browser to our servers at all times so no unauthorized party can read the information as it is carried over the Internet.
</p><p>
<b>Certificate Authority</b> - The servers hosting the Service have been certified by a Certificate Authority to assure you that you are actually talking to the Service instead of someone pretending to be us. If you are using an older browser, such as anything prior to versions 4.0 on Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see that the Certificate Authorities key may have expired; you will need to update your browser
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b> - During your use of the Service, our Internet banking Service Provider will pass an encrypted cookie to your computer in order to identify your computer during the session. This cookie enables us to process multiple transactions during the session without having to provide an Username and Password for each individual transaction. Users must accept this cookie to use the Service. This cookie does not contain any personal information; it simply provides another level of security for our Internet banking product. The cookie is stored on your computer’s hard-drive, identifying your computer while you are logged on. When you log off, close your browser, or turn off your machine, the cookie will be destroyed. A new cookie is used for each session; thus, no one can use the prior cookie to access your account.

   </p><div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="additional">Additional Security Guidelines:</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
</p><ul>
<li>All Authorized Users should sign-off after every Service session; however, online sessions will automatically end after ten (10) minutes of inactivity. This to protect you in case you accidentally leave your computer unattended after you log-in.
</li><li>The security of public computers (e.g. in a library, or Internet café) cannot be assured; therefore we recommend that you refrain from accessing the Service on a public computer.
</li><li>Routinely scan your computer, servers, and electronic media using reliable virus detection and anti-spyware products. Undetected or un-repaired viruses or spyware may affect the performance of your computer, corrupt and destroy your programs, files, and even your hardware. Additionally, you may unintentionally transmit sensitive data to another third party or transmit a virus to other computers.
</li><li>Use a firewall product (hardware and/or software), especially if you have a broadband Internet connection such as DSL or cable modem.
</li><li>Keep your computer’s operating system and browser fully patched for critical security issues. We recommend use of the most current, fully patched, versions of Internet browsers for accessing the Service.
</li></ul>
            <p></p>
<div class="page-header">
                <h3 id="password">Your Password Responsibilities</h3>
            </div>
            <p>

            <p>
                We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make all your transfers and Bill Payments properly. However, we shall incur no liability and any Bill Payment Service Guarantee shall be void if we are unable to complete any transactions initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:
</p><ol>
<li>If, through no fault of ours, your Eligible Account(s) and/or Payment Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account (if applicable);
</li><li>The Service and/or the payment processing center is not working properly and you know or have been advised by this Institution and/or its Service Providers about the malfunction before you execute the transaction;
</li><li>You have not provided the Service with the correct Payment Account information, or the correct name, address, phone number, or account information for the Biller;
</li><li>Your Eligible Account(s), including either your Payment Account or Billing Account, is closed;
</li><li>If your computer, software, telecommunication lines were not working properly, and this problem should have been apparent to you when you attempted the transfer or Bill Payment;
</li><li>It can be shown that the Biller received the Bill Payment within the normal delivery timeframe and failed to process the payment through no fault of ours;
</li><li>The payment or transaction request involves funds subject to hold, dispute, restriction, or legal process we believe prevents their withdrawal;
</li><li>We have reason to believe that a payment or other transaction request may not be authorized by you or any third party whose authorization we believe is necessary; and/or
</li><li>Circumstances beyond control of the Service, our Service Providers, and this Institution (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction and we have taken reasonable precautions to avoid those circumstances.
</li></ol>
Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable, if the Service causes an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from any of your Eligible Account(s), or Payment Account ,or causes funds from your Payment Account to be directed to a Biller, which does not comply with your Payment Instructions, this Financial Institution and/or its Service Providers shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to your Payment Account, and for directing to the proper Biller any previously misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges.

               In case of errors or questions about your electronic transactions, you should notify us as soon as possible through one of the following methods:
</p><ul>
<li>Telephone us at 319-bankjet during customer service hours;
</li><li>Contact us by using the Customer Support ticketing system,
</li><li>Write to us at PO Box 184, Mt. Vernon, IA 52314 or PO Box 129, Mechanicsville, IA 52306 or 405 E Fifth St, Solon, IA 52333.
</li></ul>
If you think your Account is incorrect or you need more information about an electronic transfer or Bill Payment transaction, we must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the transaction in question. You must:
<ol>
<li>Tell us your name, relevant Service account number(s), and Username;
</li><li>Describe the error or the transaction in question, and explain as clearly as possible why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and,
</li><li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
</li></ol>
If you tell us verbally, we may require that you send your complaint in writing within ten (10) Business Days after your verbal notification. We will tell you the results of our investigation within ten (10) Business Days after we hear from you, and will correct any error promptly. However, if we require more time to confirm the nature of your complaint or question, we reserve the right to take up to forty-five (45) days to complete our investigation. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account within ten (10) Business Days for the amount you think is in error. If we ask you to submit your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your account.
<p>
For errors regarding electronic transactions on new consumer accounts, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. We may take up to 20 Business Days to credit a new account for the amount you think is in error.
</p><p>
If it is determined there was no error, we will mail you a written explanation within three (3) Business Days after completion of our investigation.

                Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Username or Password has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of minimizing your possible losses. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit if applicable).
</p><p>
If consumer customers tell us within two (2) Business Days after you discover your password or other means to access your account has been lost or stolen, your liability is no more than $50.00 should someone access your account without your permission. If you do not tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use of your password or other means to access your account if you had told us, you could be liable for as much as $500.00.
</p><p>
If your account contains transfers that you did not authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the date of the transaction in question, you may lose any amount transferred without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) prevented you from telling us, we may extend the period.
