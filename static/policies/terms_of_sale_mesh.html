                Our websites and mobile applications allow you to buy and redeem our MESH Money Packs (“MESH Money Packs”). The MESH Money Pack may be initially loaded in variable amounts with specified increments and is only valid for the purchase by you (or the recipient of your MESH Money Pack) of Vendor MESH Money Packs via our websites or mobile applications. MESH Money Packs can NOT be used in retail stores. If you purchase multiple MESH Money Packs on a single day, the total/aggregate amount that you load on all the cards should not exceed $1500 in a single day. MESH Money Packs have no monthly fees and will never expire; however, based upon the laws in the applicable state, if you (or the recipient of your MESH Money Pack) do not use the MESH Money Pack your funds may be escheated to such applicable state. MESH Money Packs are not redeemable for cash and no refunds or exchanges will be provided for MESH Money Packs (except as required by law).
            </p><p>
                After purchasing a MESH Money Pack, these Terms will no longer apply and you (or the recipient of the MESH Money Pack) must redeem the MESH Money Pack by following the instructions provided by the Vendor, defined below. The MESH Money Pack will only function upon such activation. Activated MESH Money Packs may be available within seconds; however, additional time may be required for certain activations. If your MESH Money Pack has not been activated within 1 hour, please contact AES at <a href="mailto:support@myugoonline.co">support@myugoonline.co</a>
